# Overview

I made this program in order to showcase my ability to use cloud based data storage.

This program increments a number every time that the site is visited. It isn't connected to a real website and you have to launch it on your own computer and then visit the local host site.

# Cloud Database

The database that I decided to use is firbase/flask. It is fairly easy to use and connects well with python.

# Development Environment

I decided to use python because I am most familiar with that language. I also use visual studio because I am familiar with it.

- I would love to make this accessable via the internet
- I would like to create a form of journal application that connects to my own server that my kids will have access to and be able to use.
