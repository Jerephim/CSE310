# Overview

The purpose of this porgram is to show my ability to create a game in Unity.

This is a very basic game that only has one moving part with no collision. It is a fox that is supposed to make its way through a maze, but it is not finished

This code shows my ability to link assets to unity and to show a basic understanding of how to write code that effects it as well.
